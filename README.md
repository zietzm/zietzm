### Introduction üëã

Hi there! I'm **Michael Zietz**. I'm a data scientist and genetics researcher, focused on developing new statistical and machine learnings methods with applications in healthcare and biomedicine. üß¨ I'm currently a Research Data Scientist at [Cedars-Sinai Computational Biomedicine](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research-education/research/departments-institutes/computational-biomedicine.html). Previously, I did my PhD at [Columbia University DBMI](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) and studied Physics at [Penn](https://www.upenn.edu/), where I did research on heterogeneous networks in the [Greene Lab](https://greenelab.com/). üï∏Ô∏è I'm interested in methods development, reproducible research, and accelerating the pace of scientific progress on complex diseases. üè•
