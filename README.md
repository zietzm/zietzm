### Introduction üëã

Hi there! I'm **Michael Zietz**. I'm a data scientist and genetics researcher, focused on developing new statistical and machine learnings methods with applications in healthcare and biomedicine. üß¨ I'm currently finishing my PhD in Biomedical Informatics at [Columbia University DBMI](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/), working with [Nick Tatonetti](https://tatonettilab.org/). üåÉ Before that, I studied Physics at [Penn](https://www.upenn.edu/), where did research on heterogeneous networks in the [Greene Lab](https://greenelab.com/). üï∏Ô∏è I'm interested in methods development, reproducible research, and accelerating the pace of scientific progress on complex diseases. üè•
